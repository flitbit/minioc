minioc (alpha) [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/flitbit/minioc.png)](http://travis-ci.org/flitbit/minioc)
======

A miniature, conventions-based IOC implementation for nodejs.

I've got a bunch of tests to build and some readme before I'll consider this thing _ready_. But I'm also using it in a few projects so published to npm so others can try it out.

## Installation

[node.js](http://nodejs.org)
```bash
$ npm install minioc
```
